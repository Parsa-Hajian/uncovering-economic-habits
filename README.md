# Exploring Economic Patterns in Restaurant Tipping Habits with PCA

This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze and visualize restaurant tipping behaviors using the `tips` dataset from the Seaborn library. The analysis aims to uncover underlying patterns in tipping habits and their potential economic insights.

## Introduction
Tipping behavior in restaurants can provide valuable insights into economic patterns and social norms. By leveraging PCA, this project aims to identify latent factors driving tipping behaviors.

## Objective
- To use PCA for dimensionality reduction on the `tips` dataset.
- To visualize key patterns and correlations between variables such as total bill, tip amount, gender, and more.
- To derive actionable economic insights from the analysis.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning for the `tips` dataset.
- Implementation of PCA to identify principal components.
- Interactive and static visualizations of relationships and PCA results.
- Economic interpretation of findings.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Parsa-Hajian/uncovering-economic-habits
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd uncovering-economic-habits
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the Python script to perform PCA and generate visualizations:
    ```bash
    python pca_tipping_analysis.py
    ```
2. View the generated plots and insights.

## Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations:
- Pairplots to explore relationships in the dataset.
- Scree plots to visualize explained variance by principal components.
- Component loading plots to understand feature contributions.

## Future Work
- Extend the analysis to larger datasets or real-world tipping data.
- Incorporate advanced machine learning techniques to predict tipping behaviors.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for broader user accessibility.
